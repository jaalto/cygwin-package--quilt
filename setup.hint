sdesc: "Tool to work with series of patches"
ldesc: "Program manages a series of patches by keeping track of the
changes each of them makes. They are logically organized as a stack,
and you can apply, un-apply, refresh them easily by traveling into the
stack (push/pop). Quilt is good for managing additional patches
applied to a package received as a tarball or maintained in another
version control system. The stacked organization proved to be
efficient for the management of very large patch sets (more than
hundred patches)."
